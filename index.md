Quantum Computing
---------

Quantum computing aims at solving numerical tasks by exploiting  quantum phenomena such as entanglement, tunneling, superpositions and measurement. The two main routes in using quantum computing are digital circuit based approaches and analog quantum simulation. An important and promising application of these appraoches is to solve optimization problems efficiently. 

Mission
---------

Our research is dedicated to quantum computing with the aim to solve optimization problems efficiently in near future quantum devices. The focus is fundamental research of adiabatic and non-adiabatic processes, applications in machine learning and optimization as well as implementations in current qubit platfroms.
