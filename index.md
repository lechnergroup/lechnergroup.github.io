Quantum Computing
---------
A quantum computer is a device that exploits quantum phenomena such as entanglement, tunneling, superpositions and measurement to solve numerical tasks efficiently. The two main routes in realizing a quantum computer are digital circuit based approaches and analog quantum simulation. 

An important and promising application of quantum computing on near term devices is the possibility to solve optimization problems. As optimization problems are omnipresent in academic research and industry, the impact of improving on current classical optimization algorithms is a highly desirable goal. However, quantum speed-up from current approaches, such as thermally assisted quantum annealing, is still elusive. 

Mission
---------
Our research is dedicated to bridging fundmaental theoretcial research in quantum computing with current experimental platfroms with the aim to solve optimization problems efficiently in near future fully coherent quantum devices. The focus is research of coherent adiabatic and non-adiabatic processes, applications in machine learning and optimization problems as well as the investigation of implementations in different next generation qubit platforms.
